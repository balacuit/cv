    Foundry Furnace: A Web-based Concurrent Engineering Environment for Concept Design & Analysis
  category: NASA New Technology Report
  id: 50281
  date: Pending
  description: |
    The primary objectives of the Foundry Furnace software are:
    (1) Provide a state of the art environment for the design, modeling, & analysis of new concepts
    (2) Improve technical & documentation quality of formulation concepts & designs
    (3) Enable new services to support emerging mission types
    (4) Seamlessly transfer products across A-Team, Team X, proposals, and into implementation
    (5) Reduce cost & schedule of early formulation activities
    (6) Comply with current institutional/security practices
- title:   A RESTful Web service connector for Phoenix Analysis Server
  category: NASA New Technology Report

  description: |
    The software enables remote execution of engineering design models in heterogeneous distributed execution environments. It exposes its functionality as a RESTful web service, which is served using
    the NodeJS JavaScript runtime. Applications can use this software to specify inputs, trigger remote execution, and retrieve outputs from models deployed in the Phoenix Analysis Server environment.

  description: |
    IMPaCT enables comprehensive information on current NASA missions, prospective future missions, and the technologies that NASA is investing in, or considering investing in, to be accessed from a
    common Web-based interface. It allows dependencies to be established between missions and technology, and from this, the benefits of investing in individual technologies can be determined.

    Allows Java software to access JPL's C SPICE libraries.  (The SPICE libraries and supporting kernels themselves are not included;  jspice is just a glue layer that allows Java to talk to already-installed
    SPICE libraries.)
